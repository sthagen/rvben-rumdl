# MD044 - Use Proper Capitalization for Names

Aliases: `proper-names`

## What this rule does

Ensures brand names, product names, and technical terms are consistently capitalized throughout your documents.

## Why this matters

- **Professional appearance**: Incorrect capitalization looks careless and unprofessional
- **Brand respect**: Shows you care about getting company and product names right
- **Consistency**: Readers won't be confused by different variations of the same name
- **Searchability**: Consistent naming improves search results and indexing

## Examples

### ✅ Correct

With configured names:

```toml
[MD044]
names = ["JavaScript", "GitHub", "Node.js", "TypeScript"]
```

```markdown
# JavaScript Development Guide

This guide covers JavaScript best practices for GitHub projects.

We'll be using Node.js and TypeScript for our examples.
```

### ❌ Incorrect  

```markdown
# Javascript Development Guide        <!-- Should be "JavaScript" -->

This guide covers javascript best practices for github projects.
<!-- "javascript" and "github" are incorrectly capitalized -->

We'll be using NodeJS and typescript for our examples.
<!-- "NodeJS" should be "Node.js", "typescript" should be "TypeScript" -->
```

### 🔧 Fixed

## Configuration

```toml
[MD044]
names = []             # List of properly capitalized names
code-blocks = false    # Check inside code blocks (default: false)
html-elements = true   # Check inside HTML elements (default: true)
html-comments = true   # Check inside HTML comments (default: true)
```

## Automatic fixes

When enabled, this rule will:

- Replace all incorrect capitalizations with the proper version
- Preserve the context and meaning of your text
- Work across headings, paragraphs, and lists

## Special cases

- Only checks names you've configured
- Won't check inside URLs or file paths
- By default, skips code blocks (set `code-blocks: true` to check them)
- Set `html-comments: false` to skip HTML comment content
- Some names are intentionally lowercase (like "npm")
