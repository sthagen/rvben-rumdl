# rumdl Rules Reference

## A comprehensive reference of all Markdown linting rules

## Introduction

rumdl implements 69 rules for checking Markdown files. This document provides a comprehensive reference of all available rules, organized by category.
Each rule has a brief description and a link to its detailed documentation.

For information on global configuration settings (file selection, rule enablement, etc.), see the [Global Settings Reference](global-settings.md).

For flavor-specific behavior (MkDocs, MDX, Quarto), see the [Markdown Flavors Reference](flavors.md).

## Opt-in Rules

The following rules are **disabled by default** because they enforce opinionated style choices that may not suit all projects. Enable them explicitly if your project requires these checks.

| Rule              | Description            | Why opt-in                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MD060](md060.md) | Table formatting       | Makes significant formatting changes to existing tables  |
| [MD063](md063.md) | Heading capitalization | Style varies by guide (AP, Chicago, APA)                 |
| [MD072](md072.md) | Frontmatter key sort   | Many projects prefer semantic ordering over alphabetical |
| [MD073](md073.md) | TOC validation         | Requires specific TOC markers in document                |
| [MD074](md074.md) | MkDocs nav validation  | Requires `flavor = "mkdocs"` to activate                 |

### Enabling Opt-in Rules

**.rumdl.toml:**

```toml
[MD060]
enabled = true

[MD063]
enabled = true
style = "title-case"  # Optional: configure the style

[MD072]
enabled = true
```

**pyproject.toml:**

```toml
[tool.rumdl.MD060]
enabled = true

[tool.rumdl.MD063]
enabled = true
style = "title-case"

[tool.rumdl.MD072]
enabled = true
```

See each rule's documentation for available configuration options.

## Note on Missing Rule Numbers

Some rule numbers are not implemented in rumdl:

- **MD002** - Deprecated and removed from markdownlint v0.13.0 (replaced by MD041); removed from rumdl for compatibility
- **MD006** - Not implemented in DavidAnson/markdownlint (JavaScript version); removed from rumdl for compatibility
- **MD008** - Originally intended for "Unordered list spacing" but not implemented in modern markdownlint
- **MD015, MD016, MD017** - These rule numbers were never assigned in either the Ruby or Node.js versions of markdownlint

These gaps in numbering are maintained for compatibility with markdownlint rule numbering.

## Severity Levels

Rules are categorized into three severity levels based on their impact on document functionality:

### Error Severity

Rules with Error severity flag issues that break document functionality:

- **MD001** - Broken heading hierarchy prevents screen reader navigation
- **MD011** - Reversed link syntax makes links non-functional
- **MD024** - Duplicate headings create ID collisions, anchors point to wrong sections
- **MD025** - Multiple H1 elements break document outline structure
- **MD042** - Empty links have no destination and don't work
- **MD045** - Missing alt text violates WCAG accessibility requirements
- **MD051** - Invalid link fragments point to non-existent sections
- **MD057** - Links to non-existent files are broken
- **MD066** - Undefined footnote references are broken
- **MD068** - Empty footnote definitions have no content

### Warning Severity

Most rules use Warning severity by default. These flag style, formatting, and convention issues that don't break document functionality but affect readability, consistency, or best practices.

### Info Severity

Info severity is available for rules you want to track but not treat as warnings. Useful for:

- Style issues that automatic formatting will fix
- Low-priority suggestions
- Rules you're gradually adopting

### Configuring Severity

You can override default severities for any rule in your configuration file:

**.rumdl.toml:**

```toml
[MD013]
severity = "info"     # Downgrade to info (formatting will fix this)

[MD004]
severity = "error"    # Upgrade from warning to error
```

**pyproject.toml:**

```toml
[tool.rumdl.MD013]
severity = "info"

[tool.rumdl.MD004]
severity = "error"
```

Valid severity values: `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"info"` (case-insensitive)

Severity affects:

- Exit codes: Use `--fail-on` to control which severities cause exit code 1
- Output formatting: Different severities are visually distinct in console output
- LSP: Error → Error, Warning → Warning, Info → Information in your editor
- CI/CD: severity controls whether linting failures block builds

## Using Rules

Rules can be enabled, disabled, or configured in your rumdl configuration file:

```toml
# Global configuration options
[global]
# List of rules to disable
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]

# Rule-specific configurations
[MD003]
style = "atx"  # Heading style (atx, atx-closed, setext)

[MD004]
style = "consistent"  # List style (asterisk, plus, dash, consistent)
```

For more information on configuring rumdl, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Rule Severities

Each rule has a default severity level:

- **error**: Critical issues (broken links, accessibility violations)
- **warning**: Style and convention issues (default for most rules)
- **info**: Low-priority suggestions or issues that formatting will fix

You can customize rule severities in your configuration file:

```toml
[MD013]
severity = "info"  # Downgrade to info (formatting will fix this)
```

Use `--fail-on` to control which severities cause exit code 1:

- `--fail-on any` (default): Exit 1 on any violation
- `--fail-on warning`: Exit 1 on warning or error only
- `--fail-on error`: Exit 1 only on errors
- `--fail-on never`: Always exit 0

## Configuration

You can configure rumdl using a TOML configuration file. Create a default configuration file using:

```bash
rumdl init
```

This generates a `.rumdl.toml` file with default settings that you can customize.
