# Global Settings Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for rumdl's global configuration settings. Global settings control rumdl's overall behavior and apply to all rules and operations.

## Overview

Global settings are configured in the `[global]` section of your configuration file (`.rumdl.toml` or
`pyproject.toml`). These settings control file selection, rule enablement, and general linting behavior.

## Quick Reference

## Configuration Examples

### TOML Configuration (`.rumdl.toml`)

```toml
[global]
# Disable specific rules
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]

# Add opt-in rules on top of defaults (additive)
extend-enable = ["MD060", "MD063"]

# Exclude files and directories
exclude = [
    "node_modules",
    "build",
    "dist",
    "*.tmp.md",
    "docs/generated/**"
]

# Include only specific files
include = [
    "README.md",
    "docs/**/*.md",
    "**/*.markdown"
]

# Don't respect .gitignore files
respect_gitignore = false

# Set global line length (used by MD013 and other line-length rules)
line_length = 120

# Set markdown flavor (standard, mkdocs)
flavor = "mkdocs"

# Per-file flavor overrides (pattern → flavor)
[per-file-flavor]
"**/*.mdx" = "mdx"
"notebooks/**/*.qmd" = "quarto"

# Disable specific rules for specific files
[per-file-ignores]
"README.md" = ["MD033"]  # Allow inline HTML in README
"docs/api/**/*.md" = ["MD013", "MD041"]  # Generated API docs
"SUMMARY.md" = ["MD025"]  # MkDocs/mdBook table of contents
```

### pyproject.toml Configuration

```toml
[tool.rumdl]
# Global options at root level (both snake_case and kebab-case supported)
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]
extend-enable = ["MD060"]
exclude = ["node_modules", "build", "dist"]
include = ["docs/*.md", "README.md"]
respect_gitignore = true
line_length = 120
flavor = "standard"

# Per-file rule ignores (both snake_case and kebab-case supported)
[tool.rumdl.per-file-ignores]
"README.md" = ["MD033"]
"SUMMARY.md" = ["MD025"]
```

## Rule Selection Model

rumdl uses four settings to control which rules are active. These follow the same model as [Ruff's lint rule selection](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_select):

| rumdl            | Ruff equivalent | CLI flag    | Behavior                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `enable`         | `select`        | `--enable`  | Set the enabled rules         |
| `disable`        | `ignore`        | `--disable` | Set the disabled rules        |
| `extend-enable`  | `extend-select` | —           | Add rules to the enabled set  |
| `extend-disable` | `extend-ignore` | —           | Add rules to the disabled set |

### How rules are resolved

1. **Start with the base set.** If `enable` is omitted, the base set is all rules except [opt-in rules](#opt-in-rules). If `enable` is set, only the listed rules form the base set.
2. **Merge `extend-enable`.** Any rules listed in `extend-enable` are added to the base set. This is the way to activate opt-in rules without replacing the entire default set.
3. **Apply `disable` and `extend-disable`.** Rules in either list are removed. Disabling always wins over enabling.

Key behaviors:

- **`enable` omitted** — all non-opt-in rules are active (the default)
- **`enable = []`** (empty list) — *no rules are active*; this is an explicit empty allowlist, not the same as omitting `enable`
- **`enable = ["ALL"]`** — every rule is active, including opt-in rules
- **`extend-enable = ["ALL"]`** — every rule is active (same effect as `enable = ["ALL"]`)
- **`disable = ["all"]`** with no `enable` — no rules are active
- **Disabling wins** — if a rule appears in both an enable list and a disable list, it is disabled

### Config precedence and merging

rumdl loads configuration from config files
(with [per-directory resolution](#per-directory-configuration) when available),
then applies CLI overrides on top.
When CLI flags overlap with file settings:

- `--enable` and `--disable` **replace** the config file value entirely.
- `extend-enable` and `extend-disable` (config file only) **merge** additively with the base `enable`/`disable` values.

```bash
# Config file has disable = ["MD013"]
# CLI replaces it — only MD033 is disabled, MD013 is re-enabled
rumdl check --disable MD033 .
```

To disable MD033 *in addition to* whatever the config file disables, use `extend-disable` in the config file instead of CLI `--disable`.

### Opt-in rules

Some rules are excluded from the default set because they are opinionated, project-specific,
or may require configuration.
These rules must be explicitly activated via `extend-enable` or `enable = ["ALL"]`.

Current opt-in rules:

| Rule  | Description                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| MD060 | Table column formatting      |
| MD063 | Heading capitalization       |
| MD072 | Frontmatter key sort order   |
| MD073 | Table of contents validation |
| MD074 | MkDocs nav validation        |

```toml
[global]
extend-enable = ["MD060", "MD063"]
```

### Common patterns

**Use only a handful of rules (strict allowlist)**:

```toml
[global]
enable = ["MD001", "MD003", "MD022", "MD025"]
```

**Use all defaults but disable a few**:

```toml
[global]
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]
```

**Use all defaults plus opt-in rules**:

```toml
[global]
extend-enable = ["MD060", "MD072"]
```

**Use every rule including opt-in, minus a few**:

```toml
[global]
enable = ["ALL"]
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]
```

## Detailed Settings Reference

### `extends`

**Type**: `string`
**Default**: not set
**CLI Equivalent**: None (configuration file only)

Specifies a base configuration file to inherit settings from. The current config file's settings are merged on top of the base config.

This is a **top-level key** (not inside `[global]`).

**In `.rumdl.toml`:**

```toml
extends = "../base.rumdl.toml"

[global]
disable = ["MD013"]
```

**In `pyproject.toml`:**

```toml
[tool.rumdl]
extends = "../.rumdl.toml"

[tool.rumdl.global]
disable = ["MD013"]
```

**Path Resolution**:

- Relative paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory (not the working directory)
- `~/` prefix expands to the user's home directory
- Absolute paths are used as-is
- The extended file can be `.rumdl.toml`, `rumdl.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`

**Merge Behavior**:

When config B extends config A:

- **Replace fields** (`enable`, `disable`, `line-length`, `flavor`, `exclude`, etc.): B's value replaces A's if B specifies it
- **Union fields** (`extend-enable`, `extend-disable`): B's values accumulate with A's
- **Unspecified fields**: A's values are kept
- **Rule-specific settings**: B's `[MD007]` overrides A's `[MD007]` (per-key)

**Chains**:

Configs can chain: A extends B extends C. The base config is loaded first recursively, then each child merges on top. Maximum chain depth is 10.

**Circular Detection**:

Circular references (A extends B extends A) are detected and produce a clear error.

**Common Patterns**:

**Subdirectory override:**

```toml
# docs/.rumdl.toml — relaxed rules for documentation
extends = "../.rumdl.toml"

[global]
extend-disable = ["MD013"]
```

**Shared base config:**

```toml
# .rumdl.toml in each project
extends = "~/.config/rumdl/base.rumdl.toml"

[global]
disable = ["MD033"]
```

### `enable`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: not set (all rules enabled; `disable` applies normally)
**CLI Equivalent**: `--enable`

Enables only the specified rules. When this option is set, all other rules are disabled except those explicitly listed.

```toml
[global]
enable = ["MD001", "MD003", "MD013", "MD022"]
```

**Usage Notes**:

- Rule IDs are case-insensitive but conventionally uppercase (e.g., "MD001")
- `enable = []` (empty list) disables **all** rules — nothing will be linted
- Omitting `enable` entirely uses the default: all non-opt-in rules enabled, `disable` applied normally
- `enable = ["ALL"]` explicitly enables every rule including [opt-in rules](#opt-in-rules); `disable` still applies on top
- If `enable` lists specific rules, only those rules run (subject to `disable` and `extend-disable`)
- When `enable` is set, `extend-enable` entries are merged into the allowlist
- To add opt-in rules without replacing the defaults, use [`extend-enable`](#extend-enable) instead

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
rumdl check --enable MD001,MD003,MD013 .
```

### `extend-enable`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: `[]` (no additional rules)
**CLI Equivalent**: None (configuration file only)

Adds rules to the enabled set.
This is the primary way to activate [opt-in rules](#opt-in-rules)
(MD060, MD063, MD072, MD073, MD074) without replacing the default rule set.

When CLI `--enable` is used, it replaces the config file's `enable` list entirely.
`extend-enable` in the config file is always additive —
see [Config precedence and merging](#config-precedence-and-merging).

```toml
[global]
extend-enable = ["MD060", "MD063"]
```

**Usage Notes**:

- `extend-enable = ["ALL"]` enables every rule including opt-in rules (same as `enable = ["ALL"]`)
- Can be combined with `enable` — when both are set, `extend-enable` entries are merged into the `enable` allowlist
- Disabling always wins: if a rule appears in both `extend-enable` and `disable`/`extend-disable`, it is disabled
- Rule IDs are case-insensitive but conventionally uppercase

**Example: Enable opt-in rules alongside defaults**:

```toml
[global]
extend-enable = ["MD060", "MD072"]  # Add table formatting and frontmatter key sort
```

**Example: Combine with disable**:

```toml
[global]
extend-enable = ["MD060"]   # Add table formatting
disable = ["MD013"]          # Remove line length checking
```

### `disable`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: `[]` (no rules disabled)
**CLI Equivalent**: `--disable`

Disables the specified rules. All other rules remain enabled.

```toml
[global]
disable = ["MD013", "MD033", "MD041"]
```

**Usage Notes**:

- Rule IDs are case-insensitive but conventionally uppercase
- `disable = ["all"]` disables every rule; only rules listed in `enable` (if set) are active
- Commonly disabled rules include:
  - `MD013`: Line length (for projects with longer lines)
  - `MD033`: Inline HTML (for projects that use HTML in Markdown)
  - `MD041`: First line heading (for files that don't start with headings)
- Disabling always wins over enabling — if a rule appears in both `enable` and `disable`, it is disabled
- CLI `--disable` replaces the config file's `disable` list; use [`extend-disable`](#extend-disable) in the config file for values that shouldn't be overridden by CLI

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
rumdl check --disable MD013,MD033 .
```

### `extend-disable`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: `[]` (no additional rules disabled)
**CLI Equivalent**: None (configuration file only)

Adds rules to the disabled set. Always merges additively with `disable`, regardless of source.
Useful for adding disabled rules that survive CLI `--disable` overrides —
see [Config precedence and merging](#config-precedence-and-merging).

```toml
[global]
extend-disable = ["MD033", "MD041"]
```

**Usage Notes**:

- `extend-disable = ["ALL"]` disables every rule (effectively stops all linting)
- Disabling always wins over enabling: if a rule appears in both `extend-enable` and `extend-disable`, it is disabled
- Rule IDs are case-insensitive but conventionally uppercase

**Example: Disable rules that survive CLI overrides**:

```toml
[global]
disable = ["MD013"]
extend-disable = ["MD033"]  # Always disabled, even if --disable overrides the list above
```

With `rumdl check --disable MD041 .`, the result is: MD013 replaced by MD041 (from CLI), plus MD033 (from `extend-disable`, always additive). Final disabled set: MD041, MD033.

### `per-file-ignores`

**Type**: `table` (file patterns mapped to rule arrays)
**Default**: `{}` (no per-file ignores)
**CLI Equivalent**: None (configuration file only)

Disables specific rules for specific files or file patterns. This is useful when certain files have different requirements than the rest of your documentation.

```toml
[per-file-ignores]
# Disable inline HTML check for GitHub README (often has badges)
"README.md" = ["MD033"]

# Disable line length and first-line heading for generated API docs
"docs/api/**/*.md" = ["MD013", "MD041"]

# Allow multiple top-level headings in table of contents files
"SUMMARY.md" = ["MD025"]
"**/TOC.md" = ["MD025"]

# Disable heading style check for legacy documentation
"docs/legacy/**/*.md" = ["MD003", "MD022"]
```

**Pattern Syntax**:

Patterns use standard glob syntax:

- `*` matches any characters except path separators
- `**` matches any characters including path separators (recursive)
- `?` matches a single character
- `{a,b}` matches either `a` or `b` (brace expansion)

To match multiple specific files, use **brace expansion**:

```toml
[per-file-ignores]
# Match both AGENTS.md and README.md
"{AGENTS.md,README.md}" = ["MD033"]

# Match multiple directories
"{docs,guides}/**/*.md" = ["MD013"]
```

Alternatively, use separate entries (more verbose but equivalent):

```toml
[per-file-ignores]
"AGENTS.md" = ["MD033"]
"README.md" = ["MD033"]
```

> **Note**: Commas are literal characters in glob patterns. The pattern `"A.md,B.md"` matches a file literally named `A.md,B.md`, not two separate files. Use `"{A.md,B.md}"` to match multiple files.

**Usage Notes**:

- Rule IDs are case-insensitive but conventionally uppercase
- More specific patterns take precedence over general ones
- Useful for handling special files like:
  - `README.md` files (often contain badges, HTML, custom formatting)
  - Generated documentation (API docs, changelogs)
  - Table of contents files (`SUMMARY.md`, `TOC.md`)
  - Legacy or third-party documentation
- Combines with global `enable`/`disable` settings

**Behavior**:

1. Global rules are applied first
2. Per-file ignores override global settings for matching files
3. If a file matches multiple patterns, all ignores are combined

**Example with precedence**:

```toml
[global]
disable = ["MD013"]  # Disable line length globally

[per-file-ignores]
"README.md" = ["MD033", "MD041"]  # Also disable HTML and first-line heading for README
"docs/**/*.md" = ["MD033"]  # Allow HTML in docs
```

Result:

- `README.md`: MD013, MD033, MD041 disabled
- `docs/guide.md`: MD013, MD033 disabled
- `other.md`: MD013 disabled

**Common Use Cases**:

1. **MkDocs/mdBook Projects**:

    ```toml
    [per-file-ignores]
    "SUMMARY.md" = ["MD025"]  # Table of contents has multiple H1 headings
    ```

2. **GitHub Projects with Badges**:

    ```toml
    [per-file-ignores]
    "README.md" = ["MD033", "MD041"]  # Allow HTML badges, may not start with heading
    ```

3. **Generated Documentation**:

    ```toml
    [per-file-ignores]
    "docs/api/**/*.md" = ["MD013", "MD024", "MD041"]  # Relax rules for generated files
    ```

4. **Mixed Documentation Sources**:

    ```toml
    [per-file-ignores]
    "vendor/**/*.md" = ["MD013", "MD033", "MD041"]  # Third-party docs
    "legacy/**/*.md" = ["MD003", "MD022", "MD032"]  # Old docs with different style
    ```

5. **Documentation Generators with HTML Links**:

    For documentation generators (mdBook, Jekyll, Hugo) that compile markdown to HTML and place sources in different locations:

    ```toml
    [per-file-ignores]
    # mdBook projects - HTML links in book/ point to book/src/*.md sources
    "book/**/*.md" = ["MD057"]

    # Jekyll projects - HTML links in _posts/ point to generated files
    "_posts/**/*.md" = ["MD057"]
    "_docs/**/*.md" = ["MD057"]

    # Hugo projects - HTML links in content/ point to generated files
    "content/**/*.md" = ["MD057"]
    ```

    See [MD057 documentation](md057.md#handling-complex-generator-patterns) for more details.

### `exclude`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: `[]` (no files excluded)
**CLI Equivalent**: `--exclude`

Specifies files and directories to exclude from linting. Supports glob patterns.

```toml
[global]
exclude = [
    "node_modules",           # Exclude entire directory
    "build/**",              # Exclude directory and all subdirectories
    "*.tmp.md",              # Exclude files with specific pattern
    "docs/generated/**",     # Exclude generated documentation
    ".git",                  # Exclude version control directory
    "vendor/",               # Exclude third-party code
]
```

**Supported Patterns**:

- `directory/` - Exclude entire directory
- `**/*.ext` - Exclude all files with extension in any subdirectory
- `*.pattern` - Exclude files matching pattern in current directory
- `path/**/file` - Exclude specific files in any subdirectory of path

**Usage Notes**:

- Patterns are relative to the project root
- Exclude patterns are processed before include patterns
- More specific patterns take precedence over general ones
- Useful for excluding generated files, dependencies, and temporary files

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
rumdl check --exclude "node_modules,build,*.tmp.md" .
```

### `include`

**Type**: `string[]`
**Default**: `[]` (all Markdown files included)
**CLI Equivalent**: `--include`

Specifies files and directories to include in linting. When set, only matching files are processed.

```toml
[global]
include = [
    "README.md",             # Include specific file
    "docs/**/*.md",          # Include all .md files in docs/
    "**/*.markdown",         # Include all .markdown files
    "CHANGELOG.md",          # Include specific files
    "src/**/*.md",           # Include documentation in source
]
```

**Usage Notes**:

- If `include` is empty, all Markdown files are included (subject to exclude patterns)
- When `include` is specified, only matching files are processed
- Combine with `exclude` for fine-grained control
- Useful for limiting linting to specific documentation areas

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
rumdl check --include "docs/**/*.md,README.md" .
```

### `respect_gitignore`

**Type**: `boolean`
**Default**: `true`
**CLI Equivalent**: `--respect-gitignore` / `--respect-gitignore=false`

Controls whether rumdl respects `.gitignore` files when scanning for Markdown files.

```toml
[global]
respect_gitignore = true   # Default: respect .gitignore
# or
respect_gitignore = false  # Ignore .gitignore files
```

**Behavior**:

- `true` (default): Files and directories listed in ignore files are automatically excluded
- `false`: Ignore files are not considered, all Markdown files are scanned

**Supported ignore files**:

- `.gitignore` - Standard Git ignore patterns
- `.ignore` - Additional ignore patterns (used by ripgrep, fd, and other tools)

Both file types use the same gitignore pattern syntax and are respected at any level in the directory tree.

**Usage Notes**:

- This setting only affects directory scanning, not explicitly provided file paths
- Useful for linting files that are normally ignored (e.g., generated docs)
- When disabled, you may need more specific `exclude` patterns
- Use `.ignore` for rumdl-specific exclusions without affecting Git

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
# Don't respect .gitignore files
rumdl check --respect-gitignore=false .
```

### `line_length`

**Type**: `integer`
**Default**: `80`
**CLI Equivalent**: None (rule-specific only)

Sets the global default line length used by rules that check line length (primarily MD013). Rules can override this value with their own configuration.

```toml
[global]
line_length = 120  # Set global line length to 120 characters
```

**Behavior**:

- Used as the default line length for MD013 and other line-length-related rules
- Rule-specific configurations override the global setting
- Useful for projects that want a consistent line length across all line-length rules

**Usage Notes**:

- Must be a positive integer
- Common values: 80 (traditional), 100 (relaxed), 120 (modern)
- Individual rules can still override this setting in their own configuration
- When importing from markdownlint configs, top-level `line-length` is mapped to this setting

**Example with rule override**:

```toml
[global]
line_length = 100  # Global default

[MD013]
line_length = 120  # MD013 uses 120, overriding global setting
```

### `flavor`

**Type**: `string`
**Default**: `"standard"`
**CLI Equivalent**: `--flavor`

Specifies the Markdown flavor to use for parsing and linting. Different flavors have different parsing rules and feature support.

```toml
[global]
flavor = "mkdocs"  # Use MkDocs flavor
```

**Available Flavors**:

- `"standard"` (default): [CommonMark 0.31.2](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/) + GFM extensions (tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks)
- `"gfm"`: GitHub Flavored Markdown with security-sensitive HTML warnings and extended autolinks
- `"mkdocs"`: MkDocs-specific extensions (admonitions, content tabs, autorefs, mkdocstrings)
- `"mdx"`: MDX with JSX components, attributes, expressions, and ESM imports
- `"quarto"`: Quarto/RMarkdown for scientific publishing (citations, shortcodes, div blocks)

**Aliases**: `"commonmark"` is an alias for `"standard"`, `"github"` is an alias for `"gfm"`

**Behavior**:

- The `standard` flavor is based on CommonMark 0.31.2 with widely-adopted GFM extensions enabled by default
- Each flavor adjusts specific rule behavior where that system differs from standard Markdown
- See [Flavors Overview](flavors.md) for detailed rule adjustments per flavor

**Usage Notes**:

- Choose the flavor that matches your documentation system
- Use `standard` for generic Markdown or when you want the strictest linting
- Use `gfm` for GitHub-hosted documentation with security-conscious HTML handling
- Use `mkdocs` for MkDocs or Material for MkDocs projects
- Use `mdx` for React/Next.js documentation with JSX components
- Use `quarto` for scientific documents with R/Python code execution

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
# Use MkDocs flavor for linting
rumdl check --flavor mkdocs docs/
```

### `per-file-flavor`

**Type**: `table` (file patterns mapped to flavors)
**Default**: `{}` (no per-file overrides)
**CLI Equivalent**: None (configuration file only)

Specifies Markdown flavors for specific files or file patterns. This allows different parts of your project to use different Markdown dialects.

```toml
[per-file-flavor]
"docs/**/*.md" = "mkdocs"
"**/*.mdx" = "mdx"
"**/*.qmd" = "quarto"
"examples/**/*.md" = "standard"
```

**Available Flavors**:

- `"standard"` (default): Standard Markdown with GFM extensions (tables, task lists, strikethrough)
- `"gfm"` or `"github"`: Alias for standard (pulldown-cmark already supports GFM)
- `"commonmark"`: Alias for standard
- `"mkdocs"`: MkDocs-specific extensions (auto-references, admonitions)
- `"mdx"`: MDX flavor with JSX and ESM support
- `"quarto"`: Quarto/RMarkdown for scientific publishing

**Behavior**:

- Uses "first match wins" semantics - order matters in the configuration
- Patterns are matched against relative paths from the project root
- Falls back to global `flavor` setting if no pattern matches
- Falls back to auto-detection by file extension if no global flavor is set

**Pattern Syntax**:

- `*` matches any characters except path separators
- `**` matches any characters including path separators
- `?` matches a single character
- Patterns are relative to the project root

**Usage Notes**:

- Useful for projects with mixed documentation (e.g., MkDocs site + MDX components)
- Order patterns from most specific to least specific
- Auto-detection works for common extensions: `.mdx` → MDX, `.qmd`/`.Rmd` → Quarto

**Example: Mixed Documentation Project**:

```toml
[global]
flavor = "standard"  # Default for files not matching any pattern

[per-file-flavor]
# MkDocs documentation
"docs/**/*.md" = "mkdocs"

# React components with MDX
"src/components/**/*.mdx" = "mdx"

# Jupyter/Quarto notebooks
"notebooks/**/*.qmd" = "quarto"

# Keep README and CHANGELOG as standard
"README.md" = "standard"
"CHANGELOG.md" = "standard"
```

**Example: Monorepo with Multiple Doc Systems**:

```toml
[per-file-flavor]
"packages/website/docs/**/*.md" = "mkdocs"
"packages/storybook/**/*.mdx" = "mdx"
"packages/api/docs/**/*.md" = "standard"
```

### `output-format`

**Type**: `string`
**Default**: `"text"`
**CLI Equivalent**: `--output-format`
**Environment Variable**: `RUMDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT`

Specifies the output format for linting results.

```toml
[global]
output-format = "github"  # Use GitHub Actions format
```

**Available Formats**:

- `"text"` (default): One line per warning with file, line, column, rule, and message
- `"full"`: Source lines with caret underlines highlighting the exact violation location
- `"concise"`: Minimal output (one line per warning, no brackets)
- `"grouped"`: Warnings grouped by file with a header per file
- `"json"`: JSON array of all warnings (collected across files)
- `"json-lines"`: One JSON object per warning (streaming)
- `"github"`: GitHub Actions annotation format (`::warning`/`::error`)
- `"gitlab"`: GitLab Code Quality report (JSON)
- `"pylint"`: Pylint-compatible format
- `"azure"`: Azure Pipelines logging commands
- `"sarif"`: SARIF 2.1.0 for static analysis tools
- `"junit"`: JUnit XML for CI test reporters

**Precedence**:

1. CLI flag (`--output-format`) wins
2. Environment variable (`RUMDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT`) overrides config
3. Config file setting (`output-format`)
4. Default (`"text"`)

**Usage Notes**:

- Use `github` format in GitHub Actions for inline annotations
- Use `json` or `sarif` for integration with other tools
- The environment variable is useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to override the project config

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
# Use GitHub format for Actions
rumdl check --output-format github .

# Or via environment variable
RUMDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT=github rumdl check .
```

**Example GitHub Actions workflow**:

```yaml
- name: Lint Markdown
  env:
    RUMDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT: github
  run: rumdl check .
```

### `cache`

**Type**: `boolean`
**Default**: `true`
**CLI Equivalent**: `--no-cache` (to disable)

Controls whether rumdl caches linting results to speed up subsequent runs.

```toml
[global]
cache = true   # Enable caching (default)
# or
cache = false  # Disable caching
```

**Behavior**:

- `true` (default): Results are cached based on file content hashes
- `false`: Every run processes all files from scratch

**Usage Notes**:

- Caching significantly speeds up repeated linting of unchanged files
- Cache is automatically invalidated when file content changes
- Disable caching during development when debugging rule changes
- Use `--no-cache` CLI flag for one-time cache bypass without changing config

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
# Disable cache for this run only
rumdl check --no-cache .
```

### `cache_dir`

**Type**: `string`
**Default**: `.rumdl_cache`
**CLI Equivalent**: `--cache-dir`
**Environment Variable**: `RUMDL_CACHE_DIR`

Specifies the directory where rumdl stores cache files.

```toml
[global]
cache_dir = ".rumdl_cache"      # Default location
# or
cache_dir = "/tmp/rumdl-cache"  # Custom location
```

**Behavior**:

- Cache files are stored in this directory
- Directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- Each file's cache entry is based on its content hash

**Usage Notes**:

- Default `.rumdl_cache` is relative to the current working directory
- Use absolute paths for consistent behavior across different working directories
- Consider adding the cache directory to `.gitignore`
- Environment variable `RUMDL_CACHE_DIR` can override config file settings

**Example CLI usage**:

```bash
# Use custom cache directory
rumdl check --cache-dir /tmp/rumdl-cache .

# Or via environment variable
RUMDL_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/rumdl-cache rumdl check .
```

**Adding to .gitignore**:

```gitignore
# rumdl cache
.rumdl_cache/
```

## Per-Directory Configuration

When running `rumdl check .` from the project root, rumdl discovers and applies
configuration files on a per-directory basis. Files in a subdirectory with their
own `.rumdl.toml` will use that config instead of the root config.

This follows the same model as [Ruff's per-directory configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/config-file/#config-file-discovery).

### How it works

1. rumdl identifies the **project root** (the directory containing `.git`)
2. For each file being linted, rumdl searches from the file's directory upward to the project root for the nearest config file
3. Files are grouped by their effective config, and each group is linted with its own rules and settings

### Config file search order

At each directory level, rumdl checks for config files in this order:

1. `.rumdl.toml`
2. `rumdl.toml`
3. `.config/rumdl.toml`
4. `pyproject.toml` (only if it contains a `[tool.rumdl]` section)
5. Markdownlint config files (`.markdownlint.json`, `.markdownlint.yaml`, etc.) as fallback

### Subdirectory configs are standalone

Subdirectory configs are **independent** by default — they do not inherit from the root config. To inherit settings from a parent config, use [`extends`](#extends):

```text
project/
  .rumdl.toml              # line-length = 80
  README.md                 # linted with line-length = 80
  docs/
    .rumdl.toml             # standalone: only settings in this file apply
    guide.md                # linted with docs/.rumdl.toml
    api/
      endpoint.md           # also linted with docs/.rumdl.toml (walks up to docs/)
```

To make a subdirectory config inherit from the root:

```toml
# docs/.rumdl.toml
extends = "../.rumdl.toml"

[global]
line-length = 120          # Override just this setting; inherit everything else
```

### When per-directory resolution is active

Per-directory resolution only activates during **auto-discovery mode**. It is disabled when:

- `--config <file>` is used (the explicit config applies to all files)
- `--isolated` or `--no-config` is used (built-in defaults apply to all files)
- No project root is found (no `.git` directory)

### Example: monorepo with different standards

```text
monorepo/
  .rumdl.toml                  # strict defaults for most code
  docs/
    .rumdl.toml                # relaxed rules for user-facing docs
    getting-started.md
    reference/
      api.md                   # inherits docs/.rumdl.toml
  blog/
    .rumdl.toml                # different style for blog posts
    2024-01-post.md
  src/
    README.md                  # uses root .rumdl.toml (no subdirectory config)
```

```toml
# Root .rumdl.toml - strict defaults
[global]
line-length = 80
```

```toml
# docs/.rumdl.toml - relaxed for documentation
extends = "../.rumdl.toml"

[global]
line-length = 120
extend-disable = ["MD013"]
```

```toml
# blog/.rumdl.toml - standalone config for blog
[global]
line-length = 100
disable = ["MD033", "MD041"]
```

## Configuration Precedence

Settings are applied in the following order (later sources override earlier ones):

1. **Built-in defaults**
2. **Configuration file** (per-directory `.rumdl.toml` or `pyproject.toml`)
3. **Command-line arguments**

### Example: Precedence in Action

Given this configuration file:

```toml
[global]
disable = ["MD013", "MD033"]
exclude = ["node_modules", "build"]
```

And this command:

```bash
rumdl check --disable MD001,MD013 --exclude "temp/**" docs/
```

The final configuration will be:

- `disable`: `["MD001", "MD013"]` (CLI overrides file)
- `exclude`: `["temp/**"]` (CLI overrides file)
- Paths: `["docs/"]` (CLI argument)

## File Selection Logic

rumdl processes files using the following logic:

1. **Start with candidate files**:

   - If paths are provided via CLI: use those files/directories
   - Otherwise: recursively scan current directory for `.md` and `.markdown` files

2. **Apply .gitignore filtering** (if `respect_gitignore = true`):

   - Skip files/directories listed in `.gitignore` files

3. **Apply include patterns** (if specified):

   - Keep only files matching at least one include pattern

4. **Apply exclude patterns**:

   - Remove files matching any exclude pattern

5. **Apply rule filtering**:

   - Process remaining files with enabled rules only

### Example: File Selection

Given this configuration:

```toml
[global]
include = ["docs/**/*.md", "README.md"]
exclude = ["docs/temp/**", "*.draft.md"]
respect_gitignore = true
```

File selection process:

1. Start with: `docs/guide.md`, `docs/temp/test.md`, `README.md`, `notes.draft.md`
2. Apply includes: `docs/guide.md`, `docs/temp/test.md`, `README.md` (notes.draft.md excluded)
3. Apply excludes: `docs/guide.md`, `README.md` (docs/temp/test.md excluded)
4. Final files: `docs/guide.md`, `README.md`

## Common Configuration Patterns

### Strict Documentation Projects

For projects with strict documentation standards:

```toml
[global]
# Enable only essential rules
enable = [
    "MD001",  # Heading increment
    "MD003",  # Heading style
    "MD022",  # Blanks around headings
    "MD025",  # Single title
    "MD032",  # Blanks around lists
]

# Focus on documentation directories
include = [
    "README.md",
    "CHANGELOG.md",
    "docs/**/*.md",
    "guides/**/*.md",
]

# Set consistent line length for documentation
line_length = 100

# Exclude generated or temporary content
exclude = [
    "node_modules/**",
    "build/**",
    "docs/api/**",      # Generated API docs
    "*.draft.md",       # Draft documents
]
```

### Legacy Project Migration

For gradually adopting rumdl in existing projects:

```toml
[global]
# Start with basic rules only
enable = [
    "MD001",  # Heading increment
    "MD022",  # Blanks around headings
    "MD025",  # Single title
]

# Exclude problematic areas initially
exclude = [
    "legacy-docs/**",
    "third-party/**",
    "vendor/**",
]

# Process only main documentation
include = [
    "README.md",
    "docs/user-guide/**/*.md",
]
```

### Open Source Projects

For open source projects with community contributions:

```toml
[global]
# Disable rules that might be too strict for contributors
disable = [
    "MD013",  # Line length (can be restrictive)
    "MD033",  # Inline HTML (often needed for badges/formatting)
    "MD041",  # First line heading (README might start with badges)
]

# Include all documentation but exclude dependencies
include = ["**/*.md"]
exclude = [
    "node_modules/**",
    "vendor/**",
    ".git/**",
    "coverage/**",
]
```

### Development Workflow

For active development with frequent documentation changes:

```toml
[global]
# Enable rules that help maintain consistency
enable = [
    "MD003",  # Heading style
    "MD004",  # List style
    "MD022",  # Blanks around headings
    "MD032",  # Blanks around lists
    "MD047",  # Single trailing newline
]

# Include work-in-progress docs but exclude temp files
include = ["docs/**/*.md", "*.md"]
exclude = [
    "*.tmp.md",
    "*.draft.md",
    ".backup/**",
    "node_modules/**",
]

# Don't respect .gitignore to catch uncommitted docs
respect_gitignore = false
```

## Validation and Debugging

### View Effective Configuration

To see how your global settings are applied:

```bash
# View full effective configuration
rumdl config

# View only global settings
rumdl config get global

# View specific global setting
rumdl config get global.exclude
```

### Test File Selection

To see which files would be processed:

```bash
# Dry run with verbose output
rumdl check --verbose --dry-run .

# Or use a simple script to list files
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.markdown" | head -10
```

### Common Configuration Issues

1. **No files found**: Check your `include`/`exclude` patterns and `respect_gitignore` setting
2. **Too many files**: Add more specific `exclude` patterns or limit `include` patterns
3. **Rules not applying**: Verify rule names in `enable`/`disable` lists (case-insensitive but check spelling)
4. **Performance issues**: Exclude large directories like `node_modules`, `vendor`, or build outputs

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Lint Markdown
  run: |
    rumdl check --output json . > lint-results.json
    rumdl check .  # Also show human-readable output
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/rvben/rumdl-pre-commit
  rev: v0.0.200
  hooks:
    - id: rumdl
      args: [--config=.rumdl.toml]
```
