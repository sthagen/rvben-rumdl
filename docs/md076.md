# MD076 - List item spacing should be consistent

Aliases: `list-item-spacing`

## What this rule does

Enforces consistent blank-line spacing between consecutive items in a list.
Within each list, every inter-item gap must follow the same style: either all
gaps have a blank line (**loose**) or none do (**tight**).

## Why this matters

- **Visual consistency**: Mixing tight and loose gaps in a single list looks
  accidental and is harder to read.
- **Rendered output**: Many renderers apply extra `<p>` wrapping around list
  items that have blank lines between them. Inconsistency causes some items to
  render as paragraphs and others not, producing an uneven result.

## Examples

### Tight list (no blank lines between items)

#### Correct

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

#### Incorrect (mixed spacing)

```markdown
- Item 1

- Item 2
- Item 3
```

### Loose list (blank line between every item)

#### Correct

```markdown
- Item 1

- Item 2

- Item 3
```

#### Incorrect (mixed spacing)

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2

- Item 3
```

### Ordered lists

The rule applies equally to ordered lists:

```markdown
1. First

2. Second

3. Third
```

## Configuration

```toml
[MD076]
style = "consistent"  # "consistent" (default), "loose", or "tight"
```

| Value          | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"consistent"` | Within each list the majority style wins; on a tie, loose is preferred  |
| `"loose"`      | Every inter-item gap must contain a blank line                          |
| `"tight"`      | No inter-item gap may contain a blank line                              |

## Automatic fixes

This rule can automatically fix violations:

- **Missing blank lines** (tight gap when loose is required): a blank line is
  inserted before the next list item.
- **Unexpected blank lines** (loose gap when tight is required): the blank line
  is removed.

Fixes preserve blockquote prefixes (e.g., `>` characters) when list items
appear inside a blockquote.

## Nested lists

Nested lists are analysed independently from their parent list. A tight parent
with a loose nested list (or vice versa) triggers no warning on the parent
level; only the spacing at each nesting level's own items is checked.
